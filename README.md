cws-shelf-upload
================

[Shelf] is a generic API and making something generic means that it can be complicated to work with. This tool is aimed at narrowing down how Shelf is used specifically for Connected World Services.

		--svn-build <BUILD>    Optional: Sets the VCS Reference string to a

	If there are any problems, this program exits with a non-zero status code.

Before this tool, the only way to upload things to [Shelf] was to use tools like curl which can be difficult to use even for people familiar with it. `cws-shelf-upload` was created as a stop gap for a full UI. It is an improvement in the following ways:

* No need to type in host and protocol.
* No need to think about the path you want to upload an artifact in. We just require you to provide `--shelf` and `--component` and the file you are uploading.
* Ensure the path is unqiue so there are no conflicts.
* Forces `--version` to be provided so that downstream systems can rely on it being there.
* Ensures the file uploaded was uploaded without becoming corrupt by validating its `md5Hash`.
* Provides a more shell friendly format for metadata. No need to enter JSON.

There are, however, many things this tool does NOT do:

* Searching.
* Create/Read/Update/Delete metadata when an artifact is not being uploaded.

Files will be uploaded to Shelf using a path that's constructed using this pattern:

    /<shelf>/artifact/<component>/<timestampAndRandomId>/<file>

The timestamp is in the format YYYY-MM-DD-HH-MM-SS.SSS. The random id is 10 characters long. It exists to make conflicts less likely.


Metadata Parsing
----------------

Everything before the first colon(:) will be the metadata name and everything afterwards will be the value. That means that although the Shelf API supports it, you cannot make a metadata property with a name that has a colon in it.

Examples
--------

For full information on the tool use the `--help` option. The following is an example of uploading a new code base for the "reporting-api" to the "shadow" product. I also want to add a `buildNumber` to my new artifact.

Note: `--shelf` is what some would refer to as a "bucket" or "storage".

    $ export SHELF_AUTH_TOKEN="supersecrettoken"
    $ cws-shelf-upload --shelf="shadow" --component="reporting-api" --version=1.0.0 --immutable=buildNumber:4 reporting-api.gz.tar
    Successfully uploaded artifacts.
    https://api.shelf.cwscloud.net/shadow/artifact/reporting-api/2017-02-17-15-58-29.397Z-5jHodx2U3J/reporting-api.gz.tar
    Done

You can use the full URI given back to perform other [Shelf] queries.

You can also upload multiple files to the same directory if you need to.

    $ export SHELF_AUTH_TOKEN="supersecrettoken"
    $ cws-shelf-upload --shelf=shadow --component=app-engine --version=1.0.0 application.jar override-config-example.json
    Successfully uploaded artifacts.
    https://api.shelf.cwscloud.net/shadow/artifact/app-engine/2017-02-23-17-27-39.589-GyVnIMEET8/applicatin.jar
    https://api.shelf.cwscloud.net/shadow/artifact/app-engine/2017-02-23-17-27-39.589-GyVnIMEET8/override-config-example.json
    Done
