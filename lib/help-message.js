METADATA PARSING

Everything before the first colon(:) will be the metadata name and
everything afterwards will be the value. That means that although
the Shelf API supports it, you cannot make a metadata property with
a name that has a colon in it.

Notes:

Files will be uploaded to Shelf using a path that's constructed using this
pattern:

    /<shelf>/artifact/<component>/<timestampAndRandomId>/<file>

The timestamp is in the format YYYY-MM-DD-HH-MM-SS.SSS.
The random id is 10 characters long. It exists to make conflicts less likely.

After uploading the file, its MD5 hash and size are compared against the
metadata on the server to guarantee that the file was uploaded correctly.

If there are any problems, this program exits with a non-zero status code.`;
